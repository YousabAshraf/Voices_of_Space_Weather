## 📖 Project Overview

**Voices of Space Weather** is an interactive, web-based educational platform designed for children aged **8–12 years**. The project transforms complex space weather and solar science concepts into engaging, character-driven stories that show how space weather impacts everyday life.

Through five relatable characters, children explore real-world effects of solar storms, watch short educational videos, complete quizzes, earn badges, and receive certificates — all while building curiosity and resilience toward STEM topics.

## 🎯 What Did We Develop?

We developed an interactive storytelling platform where users choose between **five character cards**, each representing a profession affected by space weather:

* 🌾 **Farmer Kareem** – GPS disruptions in agriculture
* ✈️ **Captain Nova (Pilot)** – Aviation communication blackouts
* 👩‍🚀 **Astronaut Chen** – Radiation and astronaut safety
* ⚙️ **Engineer Sam** – Power grid and infrastructure risks
* 👧 **Lina (Child)** – Auroras and curiosity-driven discovery

Each character features:

* An educational video
* A short interactive quiz (5 questions)
* Points, badges, and progress tracking

---

## 🚀 How Does It Work?

1. User selects a character card from the home page
2. An animated educational video plays, showing a realistic scenario
3. The user completes a short quiz based on NASA-backed facts
4. Points are awarded and badges unlocked
5. Progress is tracked across all characters (score range: 0–5)
6. Completion unlocks a **digital certificate** and achievement gallery

Navigation flows smoothly across:

* Home
* Character Videos
* Quizzes
* Achievements
* Certificates
* About Page

All interactions are enhanced with child-friendly animations and feedback.
